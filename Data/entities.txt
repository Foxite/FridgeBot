The ServerFridge and ServerEmote are cached in RAM. The cache is readonly and refreshed every minute, or when a user changes something with a command 
When a reaction event is received it checks if the message is eligible for fridging. If it is then it checks if the message already has a FridgeEntry. If not then it creates one and posts a message to the fridge. If there is, the message is updated. 
There is at most on FridgeEntry per message and one or more FridgeEntryEmote per FridgeEntry
A fridge message contains:
- the emotes and amounts (that are relevant to fridging)
- the nickname of the author
- their role icon, if it can be linked to an emote
- their server profile image
- the timestamp of the message
- the contents
- a link to the message
- the contents of/link to the message it is a reply to (if any)
